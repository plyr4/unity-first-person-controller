# unity-first-person-controller

this repo contains some starter scripts for getting a project off the ground using Unity's new input management system to create a first person controller.

so far, the code supports the following:
- player actions (WASD, space, mouse)
- player movement (horizontal, gravity, jumping)
- player looking (mouse input camera rotation)
